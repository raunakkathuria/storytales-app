## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these screens, consider the following:

1. **Responsive Design**
   - **Use ResponsiveText for all text elements**:
     - Ensures text scales properly with device settings
     - Maintains consistent typography across different devices
     - Improves accessibility for users with visual impairments
   - **Use ResponsiveIcon for all icons**:
     - Standardizes icon sizing using size categories
     - Adapts to different screen densities and accessibility settings
   - **Follow responsive layout principles**:
     - Ensure layouts adapt to different screen sizes
     - Maintain proper spacing and readability on various devices
     - Use BoxFit.cover with center alignment for images
     - Position text containers with appropriate margins from screen edges (16-24px)
     - For dialogs, ensure proper keyboard handling with sufficient scrolling

2. **Accessibility**
   - Use sufficient contrast for text overlays
   - Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized
   - Consider text scaling for users with visual impairments
   - Implement text with multiple shadows for better readability against varied backgrounds
   - Use semi-bold text weight (FontWeight.w600) for improved legibility
   - Make form fields accessible with proper labels and error messages

3. **Text Overlay Design**
   - Position text container at the bottom of the screen with 24px bottom margin
   - Use semi-transparent black background (70% opacity) with rounded corners (12px radius)
   - Apply consistent padding inside text containers (24px horizontal, 16px vertical)
   - Ensure text container width adapts to screen size with appropriate margins
   - Use consistent text styling across story pages and question pages:
     - White text color for maximum contrast
     - Semi-bold weight (FontWeight.w600) for better readability
     - Text shadows to ensure visibility against any background

4. **Immersive Experience & System UI**
   - Extend content to the edges of the screen (edge-to-edge)
   - Make status bar transparent to maximize immersion
   - Implement smooth transitions between pages
   - Consider subtle animations for page turns
   - Keep animations child-friendly and not distracting
   - For the bottom sheet, use a rounded top border radius (20px) for a modern look

5. **Branding Consistency**
   - Apply the "Storybook Sky" color palette from the branding document
   - Use the specified fonts for headings and body text
   - Maintain consistent styling across all screens
   - Use the accent color for primary actions like the "Generate Story" button

6. **Interactive Elements**
   - Ensure favorite and delete icons have appropriate feedback when tapped
   - Make the bottom navigation buttons prominent and easy to tap
   - Implement intuitive swipe gestures for page navigation
   - Ensure navigation areas cover the left/right halves of the screen for easy page turning
   - For the bottom sheet, implement proper keyboard handling to avoid input fields being covered

7. **Dialog Box Guidelines**
   - Use the ConfirmationDialog utility class for consistent styling
   - Ensure dialog buttons have appropriate colors based on action type
   - Make destructive actions (like delete) use the error color
   - Position the primary action on the right side
   - Ensure dialog content is clear and concise

These wireframes serve as a visual guide for the UI implementation. The actual implementation should follow the clean architecture and BLoC pattern as specified in the technical documentation.
