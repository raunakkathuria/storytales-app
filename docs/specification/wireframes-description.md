   - Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized
   - Consider text scaling for users with visual impairments

3. **Animations & Transitions**
   - Implement smooth transitions between pages
   - Consider subtle animations for page turns
   - Keep animations child-friendly and not distracting

4. **Branding Consistency**
   - Apply the "Under the Sea" color palette from the branding document
   - Use the specified fonts for headings and body text
   - Maintain consistent styling across all screens

5. **Interactive Elements**
   - Ensure favorite and delete icons have appropriate feedback when tapped
   - Make the floating action button prominent and easy to tap
   - Implement intuitive swipe gestures for page navigation

These wireframes serve as a visual guide for the UI implementation. The actual implementation should follow the clean architecture and BLoC pattern as specified in the technical documentation.
