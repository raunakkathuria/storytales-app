# Cross-Device Synchronization - Phase 2

## Overview

The Cross-Device Synchronization feature enables users to access their stories across multiple devices. This document outlines the technical specifications, implementation details, and best practices for this feature, which builds upon the Authentication & User Management feature.

## Key Components

1. **Cloud Database**: Firestore-based storage for user stories and related data
2. **Sync Service**: Mechanism to synchronize data between local and cloud storage
3. **Conflict Resolution**: System to handle conflicting changes from different devices
4. **Offline Support**: Capability to work offline and sync when connectivity is restored

## Technical Specifications

### 1. Cloud Database Schema

#### 1.1 Stories Collection

- **Path**: `stories/{storyId}`
- **Fields**:
  - `userId`: Owner of the story
  - `title`: Story title
  - `summary`: Brief summary
  - `coverImagePath`: Path to cover image
  - `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: Last update timestamp
  - `author`: Author name
  - `ageRange`: Target age range
  - `readingTime`: Estimated reading time
  - `originalPrompt`: Original prompt used for generation
  - `genre`: Story genre
  - `theme`: Story theme
  - `isPregenerated`: Whether the story is pre-generated
  - `isFavorite`: Whether the story is marked as favorite
  - `syncStatus`: Synchronization status (synced, pending, conflict)
  - `lastSyncedAt`: Last synchronization timestamp

#### 1.2 Pages Subcollection

- **Path**: `stories/{storyId}/pages/{pageId}`
- **Fields**:
  - `pageNumber`: Page number within the story
  - `content`: Text content
  - `imagePath`: Path to page illustration

#### 1.3 Questions Subcollection

- **Path**: `stories/{storyId}/questions/{questionId}`
- **Fields**:
  - `questionText`: Text of the discussion question
  - `questionOrder`: Order in the list

### 2. Sync Service

The `SyncService` will handle synchronization between local and cloud storage:

- **Initialization**: Set up listeners for changes in both local and cloud data
- **Full Sync**: Synchronize all stories for the current user
- **Incremental Sync**: Synchronize only changed stories
- **Upload**: Send local stories to the cloud
- **Download**: Retrieve cloud stories to local storage
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify conflicting changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts based on defined strategies
- **Background Sync**: Perform synchronization in the background

### 3. Conflict Resolution Strategies

#### 3.1 Last-Write-Wins

- Use timestamps to determine which version is newer
- Apply the most recent changes

#### 3.2 Field-Level Merging

- Merge non-conflicting fields from both versions
- Use timestamps to resolve conflicts in the same field

#### 3.3 User Preference

- Present both versions to the user
- Allow the user to choose which version to keep or merge manually

### 4. Offline Support

#### 4.1 Offline Queue

- Queue changes made while offline
- Process the queue when connectivity is restored
- Handle conflicts that may arise during queue processing

#### 4.2 Connectivity Monitoring

- Monitor network connectivity changes
- Trigger sync when connectivity is restored
- Provide visual indicators of sync status

### 5. Image Synchronization

#### 5.1 Image Storage

- Store images in Firebase Storage
- Use consistent naming conventions for easy reference
- Implement caching for efficient access

#### 5.2 Image Upload/Download

- Compress images before upload
- Prioritize downloading images for visible content
- Implement background downloading for non-visible content

### 6. Sync BLoC

The sync BLoC will manage the synchronization state and handle sync-related events:

#### 6.1 Events
- Initialize sync
- Perform full sync
- Sync specific story
- Handle connectivity change
- Resolve conflict

#### 6.2 States
- Initial state
- Syncing state
- Sync success state
- Sync error state
- Conflict state
- Offline state

### 7. UI Components

#### 7.1 Sync Status Indicator

- Visual indicator of sync status (synced, syncing, offline)
- Located in the app header or library screen
- Provides feedback on sync operations

#### 7.2 Conflict Resolution UI

- Dialog to present conflicting versions
- Options to keep local version, keep cloud version, or merge
- Visual comparison of differences

### 8. Security Considerations

#### 8.1 Data Access Control

- Firestore security rules to restrict access to user's own data
- Validation rules to ensure data integrity
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### 8.2 Sensitive Data Handling

- Encrypt sensitive data before storage
- Implement proper token management
- Handle authentication errors gracefully

### 9. Performance Optimization

#### 9.1 Batch Operations

- Use batch writes for multiple operations
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Optimize query patterns

#### 9.2 Caching Strategy

- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement time-to-live (TTL) for cached data
- Clear cache when necessary

#### 9.3 Bandwidth Optimization

- Compress data before transmission
- Implement delta updates
- Prioritize essential data during initial sync

## User Experience Guidelines

1. **Transparent Synchronization**: Sync should happen automatically in the background
2. **Clear Status Indicators**: Users should understand the current sync status
3. **Minimal Disruption**: Sync operations should not interrupt the user experience
4. **Conflict Handling**: Present conflicts clearly and provide simple resolution options
5. **Offline First**: App should work seamlessly offline with clear indicators

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test sync service and conflict resolution logic
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between local and cloud storage
3. **Connectivity Tests**: Test behavior under various network conditions
4. **Conflict Tests**: Test handling of various conflict scenarios
5. **Performance Tests**: Measure sync performance with different data volumes

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Cloud database schema design and implementation
2. **Week 2**: Basic sync service implementation
3. **Week 3**: Conflict resolution and offline support
4. **Week 4**: UI components and performance optimization

## Future Considerations

1. **Selective Sync**: Allow users to choose which stories to sync
2. **Sync History**: Provide history of sync operations and changes
3. **Cross-Platform Expansion**: Extend sync to web and desktop platforms
4. **Advanced Conflict Resolution**: Implement more sophisticated conflict resolution strategies
