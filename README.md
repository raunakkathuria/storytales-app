# StoryTales

StoryTales is an AI-powered storytelling app for children aged 3-12 that generates personalized stories with illustrations. This repository contains the technical specifications, wireframes, and implementation guidelines for the app.

## Current Development Status

- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Completed (April 2025) - Version 1.0.0
- **Phase 1 Patch**: ‚úÖ Released (April 23, 2025) - Version 1.0.1
- **Phase 2**: üöß In Progress - Core features enhanced, authentication system removed for future Supabase implementation

For detailed implementation status, see the [CHANGELOG](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## Project Overview

StoryTales allows users to:
- Generate personalized children's stories using AI
- Read pre-generated bundled stories
- Save stories to a local library for offline reading
- Access 2 free stories before hitting a subscription paywall
- View discussion questions at the end of each story

The app is built with Flutter using the BLoC pattern for state management, SQLite for local storage, and Firebase Analytics for event tracking. Authentication features have been temporarily removed to prepare for future Supabase JWT implementation.

- **Production Configuration** ‚úÖ (Implemented)
  - Firebase production setup with emulator fallback (Analytics & Crashlytics only)
  - Enhanced API client with comprehensive logging
  - Environment-specific configuration management
- **Cross-Device Synchronization** üìÖ (Postponed)
  - Awaiting future authentication system implementation
  - Will be implemented with Supabase JWT authentication
- **Enhanced Library Features** üìÖ (Planned)
  - Advanced search and filtering
  - Tags system for categorization
- **Pre-Generated Stories API** ‚úÖ (Implemented)
  - API integration for fetching curated stories from server
  - Automatic background loading of API stories

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Review the appropriate technical specification based on the feature you're working on:
   - For Phase 1 features: [Phase 1 Technical Specification](docs/specification/phase-one-technical-specification.md)
   - For Phase 2 features: [Phase 2 Overview](docs/specification/phase-two/overview.md)
3. Understand the [Data Model](docs/specification/data-model.md) and [Wireframes](docs/specification/wireframes-description.md)
4. Follow the [Branding](docs/guidelines/branding.md) and [Coding Guidelines](docs/guidelines/coding-guidelines.md)
5. Implement the app according to the specifications

## Phase Completion Criteria

### Phase 1 (Completed)

Phase 1 was considered complete when:
- 1,000+ active users within a reasonable timeframe
- ‚â• 4.0 average rating in app stores
- ‚â•95% story generation success rate
- ‚â•98% crash-free sessions
- User feedback on the MVP's core features was gathered

### Phase 2 (In Progress)

Phase 2 will be considered complete when:
- Enhanced library features are implemented
- Pre-generated stories API is integrated ‚úÖ
- In-app feedback mechanisms are in place
- User satisfaction metrics show improvement over Phase 1
- Foundation is prepared for future Supabase authentication implementation

**Note**: Authentication & user management and cross-device synchronization have been postponed to allow for a clean Supabase JWT implementation in the future.
